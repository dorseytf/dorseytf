## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data scientist passionate about the political economy of transitioning to a sustainable economic system.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m in the planning stages of a Stock-Flow Consistent-EEIO Model for Taiwan
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with anyone interested in finding policies to help Taiwan's transition to a sustainable economic system
